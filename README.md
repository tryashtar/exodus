I don't know about you, but when I get a new computer, it takes multiple days to set everything up correctly. Gotta install all those programs I like, sign in to all my accounts, change my Windows settings just so, get the right drivers, connect to WiFi, set my "open with" programs again, re-configure all my applications, tweak the registry, disable Cortana, set my desktop background, enable file extensions in file explorer, and so much more!

Just when it feels like everything is set up properly, I'll notice something missing from my old computer, and have to remember what convoluted steps I had to do to get that behavior in the first place.

Anyway the point of this program is you list a bunch of stuff you want to copy from your old computer, and then you create an export. And then you run it again on the new computer and it imports everything.
